### About the App
This repo holds the codes from our web project - PetsApp - which is a social matching application based on the shared pets picture from users. The main purpose of our app is, to connect the people with their shared interests on pets.

Feel free to sign up first with an anonymous username and password and try out the feature. If you get matched with other users, you could start a chat with each other. Sounds exciting? 

👉 Take a look and start matching!
